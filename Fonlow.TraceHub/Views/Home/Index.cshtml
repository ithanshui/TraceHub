        <h2>TraceHub Service/MVC/Slim</h2>
        <p>TraceHub Service optionally accompanied with MVC Web UI or Slim Web UI is to provide centralized logging for Web and service applications through extending System.Diagnostics of .NET Framework. 
        Traces from service applications could be displayed in TraceHub’s logging page.</p>

        <h2>HubTraceListener</h2>
        <p>HubTraceListener is a derived class from TraceListenerBase of Essential.Diagnostics, while Essential.Diagnostics is an extension of System.Diagnostics, providing structure tracing and logging. Your .NET applications utilizing System.Diagnostics can utilize TraceHub through HubTraceListner without you altering one line of application codes, since trace listeners could be injected through app.config.</p>

        <h2>TraceHub Console</h2>
        <p>TraceHub Console is a Windows console application that displays traces aggregated in TraceHub which will push traces to the Console when traces arrive. The Console is an alternative to TraceHub’s logging page. And because of the architecture of System.Diagnostics, you could easily introduce new sinks of traces through injecting trace listeners in BCL of .NET Framework and Essential.Diagnostics, as well as your own custom trace listeners. </p>
